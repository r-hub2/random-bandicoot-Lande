# prepare_selection_data
#
# Purpose:
#   1. Check fitness and traits columns
#   2. Handle missing values (including group column)
#   3. Standardize trait variables (optionally within groups)
#   4. Compute relative fitness (optionally within groups)
#
# Groups:
#   For studies spanning several years, sites or populations, standardise the
#   traits within each group (year, site) rather than over all individuals
#   pooled, so each individual is compared with others in the same year and
#   place. Relative fitness is computed within the same group.
#
#   This approach is equivalent to including group fixed effects in the
#   regression models. However, it does NOT allow testing for group-by-trait
#   interactions (i.e., whether selection varies across years). For that,
#   researchers should fit separate models per group or include interaction
#   terms in the regression.
#
# Parameters:
#   data           : data frame containing fitness and trait measurements
#   fitness_col    : name of the fitness column (character)
#   trait_cols     : vector of trait column names
#   standardize    : logical; if TRUE, standardize traits to mean 0, SD 1
#   group          : optional grouping variable (e.g., "year", "site", "population")
#                    When specified, standardization and relative fitness are
#                    calculated separately within each group level.
#   add_relative   : logical; if TRUE, add a relative fitness column
#   na_action      : how to handle NAs ("warn", "drop", "none")
#   name_relative  : name for the relative fitness column
#
# Returns:
#   Modified data frame with:
#     - Standardized traits (if standardize = TRUE)
#     - Relative fitness column (if add_relative = TRUE)
#     - Potentially dropped NA rows (if na_action = "drop")
