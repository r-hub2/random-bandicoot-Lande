#' Pupfish hybrid survival in two San Salvador lakes
#'
#' Laboratory-reared F2 hybrids of the three pupfish species of San Salvador
#' Island, Bahamas, photographed, tagged and released into field enclosures in
#' Crescent Pond and Little Lake from March to June 2011, with
#' laboratory-reared fish of the three species measured the same way. Martin
#' (2016) analysed the high-density enclosures, \code{density == "H"}, as do
#' the examples and the app.
#'
#' The trait columns are Martin's scores for the 16 measurements of Martin and
#' Wainwright (2013), taken from the photographs. He log-transformed the
#' distances, regressed each trait on a size index (the first principal
#' component of seven size-related distances) and kept the residuals, fitting
#' the regression to the parental fish alone for \code{jaw}, \code{mouth},
#' \code{nasal} and \code{width}; \code{eye2}, \code{nose} and
#' \code{noseangle} were not size-corrected. Every trait is standardised to
#' mean 0 and standard deviation 1 within each lake, hybrids and parental fish
#' together.
#'
#' The column names are Martin's. The trait names below are the ones defined
#' in the supplement to Martin and Wainwright (2013), matched to the columns
#' through his size-correction script (in the Dryad archive) and their
#' discriminant loadings, with the name Martin (2016) uses in brackets where
#' it differs. The six functional traits of his Table 3 are \code{jaw},
#' \code{pmx}, \code{nose}, \code{noseangle}, \code{body} and \code{eye}. Their
#' loadings table swaps the labels of \code{snout} and \code{nasal}; the names
#' here follow the size-correction script.
